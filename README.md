Learn JPA and Hibernate
Overview
The Learn JPA and Hibernate repository is designed to provide a comprehensive guide and practical implementation of Java Persistence API (JPA) and Hibernate, which are essential technologies for managing relational data in Java applications. This project serves as a hands-on learning tool for developers who wish to deepen their understanding of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) concepts and database interactions using Spring Boot.

Features
CRUD Operations: Demonstrates how to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.
Entity Relationships: Illustrates different types of relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many) between entities.
Custom Queries: Includes examples of using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) and the Criteria API for complex queries.
Spring Boot Integration: Integrates JPA with Spring Boot for easy configuration and setup.
H2 Database: Utilizes H2 in-memory database for testing and demonstration purposes, with an option to configure other databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
